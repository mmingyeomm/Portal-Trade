**Leveraging Lending Protocol Yields for Arbitrage**

Portal Trade is an innovative dual-token lending system with a built-in arbitrage mechanism that automatically optimizes yields for users while maintaining the simplicity of traditional lending protocols.

## 🎯 What is Portal Trade?

Portal Trade is a next-generation lending protocol that combines traditional lending with automated arbitrage strategies. Unlike conventional lending protocols, Portal Trade uses a sophisticated dual-token system to maximize returns for users through automated yield optimization.

### Key Features

- **🤖 Automated Arbitrage**: Built-in arbitrage bot executes trading strategies automatically
- **💰 Dual Token System**: aTokens for standard deposits, bTokens for arbitrage deposits
- **⚡ Real-time Optimization**: Yields are used instantaneously for maximum efficiency
- **🔒 Secure & Transparent**: Blockchain-based smart contract automation
- **🌐 24/7 Accessibility**: Available from anywhere, anytime

## 🔧 How It Works

### The Dual Token System

#### aToken (Standard Deposit Token)
- Represents regular user deposits
- Earns 5.00% annual yield
- Can be used as collateral for borrowing
- Similar to AAVE's standard deposit tokens

#### bToken (Arbitrage Token)
- Represents arbitrage deposits
- Receives share of profits from arbitrage bot
- Earns 5.00% APY + α (additional arbitrage profits)
- Tokens are locked for a fixed period
- Restricted to designated arbitrage wallet

### Arbitrage Mechanism

Step 1: Pool Contract distinguishes Arbitrage Deposits
↓
Step 2: Funds automatically moved to Arbitrage Wallet
↓
Step 3: Arbitrage Wallet executes trades for maximum profit
↓
Result: Profits redistributed to bToken holders

#### Detailed Process Flow

1. **🔍 Deposit Recognition**
   - Pool Contract automatically identifies arbitrage deposits
   - Separates bToken deposits from standard aToken deposits

2. **💸 Fund Transfer**
   - Funds are automatically moved to designated Arbitrage Wallet
   - Process occurs at regular intervals for optimal efficiency

3. **🤖 Arbitrage Execution**
   - Arbitrage Wallet executes automated trading strategies
   - Maximizes profit through yield differential exploitation

4. **📈 Profit Distribution**
   - Generated profits are redistributed to bToken holders
   - Additional returns on top of base 5.00% APY
